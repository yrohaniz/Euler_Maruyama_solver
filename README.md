# Euler_Maruyama_solver
This is a simple Euler-Maruyama solver.
It is the simplest numerical scheme for estimating the solution of an ordinary stochastic differential equation. 
The strong order of convergence for this method is 0.5. The code uses the polar Marsaglia method to simulate 
the Wiener process, which is needed for calculating the Wiener increments in the numerical recipe.
